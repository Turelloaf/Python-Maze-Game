This is a super simple text based maze game. Created using only python without pygame. 
The goal is to find the exit of the maze. 
The controls are super simple, when asked which way to go you can move up, down, left, or right. 
When a direction input is given a random tunnel option is given based on the previous one that was presented.
In order to have some form of immersion within a text-based game I needed to create multiple copies of each tunnel piece in every different orientation. 

It has been some time since I worked on this, I cant remember if the code stops when the exit is found.
